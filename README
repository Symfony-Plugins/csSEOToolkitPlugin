csGlossaryPlugin
================

Allows you to easily create a Glossary or Directory out of a single model or an aggregate of multiple models.  
Models are organized alphabetically, and the alphabet is customizable.  

#Configuration

Add this to your app.yml with the models you want your glossary to use under default:

	[yml]
	all:
		glossary:
		default:
			- MyModel1
			- MyModel2
	
By Default, the csGallery class looks for a title field on the object.  If you wish for this to be different,
alter your app.yml as follows:
	
	[yml]
	all:
		glossary:
			default:
				MyModel1:  title
				MyModel2:	name
	
In this scenario, MyModel1 will be glossarized according to the title field, and MyModel2 will be glossarized 
according to name.  Both models are automatically alphabetized together.  If you have multiple glossaries in 
your project, simply declare a new glossary under default:

	[yml]
	all:
		glossary:
	  	default:
	    	MyModel1:  title
	    	MyModel2:	name
			terms_glossary:
				- Term

Now your Term glossary can be called easily.  Read about 'Usage' below to manipulate your Glossary object


#Usage

First you must create your glossary object:
	
	[php]
	$glossary = new Glossary();

This will create a glossary with the default configurations you have specified.  In order to use additional
configurations, simply pass the configuration name to the constructor:

	[php]
	$glossary = new Glossary('terms_glossary'); 	//This will apply the configuration shown in the example above

You now have your glossary object to manipulate.
